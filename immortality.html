            <h2 class="nmm">The offer</h2>
            <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The offer is very simple: <strong>Do you want to never be able to die?</strong>

"But maf", I hear you ask. "When I become, say, 200 years old, won't my whole body be paralyzed? I might not die, but I won't be able to do anything."

Okay. How about this: <strong>Do you want to never be able to die (and you stop aging after 30)?</strong>

Of course, the complains don't stop. "But the Universe will end eventually. The world will be no more. I will be left with nothing."

Sure. Now, after patching these obvious holes, I present to you, the final offer:
<strong>Do you want this: You stop aging after 30, can never be hurt or die from anything, <em>and</em> the Earth will never become unsuitable for human survival, and humanity will thrive forever in this world.</strong>

People have suggested that one would eventually suffer from a mental breakdown after all the bad experiences they have accumulated over the countless millenia that they would be alive for. This is true —— but consider: <em>You</em> are alive. Yes, you. Things may be bad. You may even be <a href="/bubble/info/gloss.html#suboptimal-practice">under the impression that <em>nothing</em> in the world is good.</a> But you should realize that you have the ability to change that. With infinite time, you have the ability to create anything. Perhaps a world where everything is nice; Perhaps <a href="https://xkcd.com/505/">a universe governed by your very own laws of nature</a>; Whatever you choose, the fact is that you would possess the tools to make everything that you ever want come true. There could (read: definitely) would be many challenges. Such an environment would almost certainly drive anyone crazy. But while you may loathe your existence during those times, it's also what forcefully keeps you alive and well, so that you can continue your pilgrimage for good (pun most definitely intended).
