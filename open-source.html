        <section>
            <p>
The Bubble defines efficiency as <a href="https://00001h.github.io/bubble/concepts/efficiency.html">achieving a goal while consuming the least resources</a>. Efficient software should facilitate the users to be efficient, meaning they must firstly let the user do what they want, and secondly do that while using the least resources. It shouldn't be hard to see that most closed-source software are inefficient. Developers are seldom able to predict all the user's needs, and modifications or plugins often need to be written to implement some missing but desired functionality. Being closed-source means that users are either unable to do what they want entirely, need complex workarounds, or must reverse-engineer the program. Even if we ignore potential legal trouble from reverse-engineering, the latter two options waste much of the user's time, which they wouldn't have had to spend if the source code of the software was made available. This is inefficiency.

            <p>
The Free Software Movement (<a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html">apparently</a>) focuses not on efficiency, but rather user freedom. This in itself is not problematic —¹ most of the time, efficiency means giving freedom to the user, since we want to enable the user to do things they want to do. However, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/pragmatic.html">copyleft</a>, supposedly an important part of the movement, is highly inefficient. Remember: efficient software should let the user do whatever they want. This should include creating proprietary derivatives. By preventing people from creating proprietary derivatives with the GPL, you essentially force these people to create their own proprietary software from scratch. This wastes their time. The Free Software Movement sees it as a win — but the Bubble is not about winning.² In fact, the Bubble identifies no enemy except for inefficiency in its members. Efficient software should be efficient to everyone, no exceptions. Knives do not magically become blunt when used to attack people. Why should software?

And finally:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>
The idea of open source is that allowing users to change and redistribute the software will make it more powerful and reliable. But this is not guaranteed. Developers of proprietary software are not necessarily incompetent. Sometimes they produce a program that is powerful and reliable, even though it does not respect the users' freedom. Free software activists and open source enthusiasts will react very differently to that.
                </p>
                <p>
A pure open source enthusiast, one that is not at all influenced by the ideals of free software, will say, “I am surprised you were able to make the program work so well without using our development model, but you did. How can I get a copy?” This attitude will reward schemes that take away our freedom, leading to its loss.
                </p>

            <p>
The Bubble member sighs, and asks: "Your software is nice and all, but how can you cater to the huge userbase with just a single dev team?".

            <small>1: I <span style="text-decoration: underline;">will</span> continue using the em dash because it is typographically more correct and visually more pleasant. If you think I'm an AI model, that's not my problem.</small>
            <small>2: Don't get me wrong — I personally believe that most software should be free. However, at the same time, I would never force those using my software or creating derivatives of my software to believe the same or make their derivatives free. I see the Bubble as a commitment to create good things yourself, without trying to defeat those doing "bad" things. Non-violence!</small>
