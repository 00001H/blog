In most languages, there are some words considered "bad", often because they're considered offensive, discriminatory, etc. <strong>This is absurd.</strong>

Consider: Words themselves are simply tokens. They don't have inherent meaning. Speaker encodes their intent in words, while listeners attempt to decode the intent, and the way we associate words with intent is what gives words meaning. This means that for a word to be able to offend, the listener must decode the word into an offensive meaning, for otherwise the offense would remain but a thought in the speaker's mind, and not in fact communicated. Consider someone who does not want to be offended by other people. It would be preferable if they never heard anything offensive, right? However, in order to hear meaning, you have to decode that meaning from words. If you don't want to be offended, simply don't decode offensive meanings from words. Consider them meaningless. Ignore them. Don't proscribe them. In the best case scenario, the vast majority of people would stop associating offensive meanings with words. These meanings get forgotten, and the words simply become meaningless tokens (excepts perhaps to archaeologists) again that may be re-used for other purposes. However, even without that happening, one can still be effectively never discriminated against. Sure, by ignoring the words, you would be misinterpreting the other person, but if all they intend is to hurt you, then misinterpretation would only be valid, for it is simply self-defense. The ill-intentioned can keep throwing words around, but as loud as they try to be, their thoughts would remain unheard, for the only thing they would be able to speak out is meaningless noise.
